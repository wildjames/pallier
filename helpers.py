def calculate_keypair(p, q, g):
    """Returns a dict, containing the public and private keys. These will be of the form:

    public  = (n, g)
    private = (lambda_n, mu)

    This is generated based off two prime numbers, p and q, and a generator, g.
    g must be an integer < n^2, where n = p * q. It is subject to some other conditions, 
    for which refer to Paillier's 1999 paper.

    If the combination of p, q, and g does not satisfy the conditions, None is returned.
    This has a notable exception! p and q are assumed to be prime; no checks are done to verify this!

    Inputs:
    -------
    p: int
        A prime number.
    q: int
        A prime number.
    g: int
        A number in the range 0 < g < n^2, that must satisfy some conditions.

    Returns:
    --------
    keypair: dict
        A dict containing the public and private keys.
